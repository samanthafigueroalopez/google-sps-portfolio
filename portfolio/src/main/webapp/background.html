                    <span class="tab"></span>Hello my name is Samantha and I am a first generation student attending San Jose
                    State University . I am born and
                    raised in San Jose , California. I am the first daughter to very loving parents who want to 
                    see me succeed in the future. We are all tied in our Spanish and Latin culture and embrace it in my family household.The photo on the top left you can see is my immediate family. In order it is my 
                    mother, little sister, myself, father, and older brother. Recently we added a new family member which is our new dog.
                    I love dogs and a quick side note I am not a cat person at all. My dog is a German Shepard and his name is Oso which can be translated as bear in English. I love to meet new
                    people and have some laughs. I love any kind of art assoiated with Frida or her story. I am a big fan of mexican artist. Also of course, I love soccer
                    due to the fact growing up in a mexican household I grew up watching soccer games with my Dad. If I were to include 
                    a weird thing about me is I am exactly like the girl from the film "SIGNS", picky about my water. I enjoy horror movies and very very passionately the marvel universe. I am 
                    approachable and want others to suceed with me.

                    <span class="tab"></span>  I enjoy making new friends,helping others, and getting close my Mexican culture. I went to Mt.
                Pleasant High School and found my love for coding there. My first computer science course really inspired me motherto pursue a career 
                in technology. On the other hand I love to work in teams and groups and was actually parts of the Marine Corps Junior
                Reserve Training Corps in high school for three years. Actually as seen in the top right image I was part of dancing clubs as 
                well due to the fact it was all just Mexican music. Additionally, I was part of the MESA , Mathematics Engineering Science Achievemment,program for three years and was haivng trouble
                finding some images. During high school my family pushed me more to pursue a career in STEM in the tech field. These are reasons on why I am attending San Jose State
                Univeristy.

               <span class="tab"></span> Since high school I love where I am at today. I graduated honors from Mt. Pleasant High School while being a scholar athlete as well.
                I am now a second year student at San Jose State University majoring in Computer Engineering. Also since I believe Earth needs help. I decided 
                as well to minor in Green/ Environmental Engineering as well. This is what is now motivating me to bring in more latinas in stem or in any tehnical field.
                My goal by the time I graduate is I hope I influenced at least one woman to show off their skills if they have them. Being a woman in STEM can very challenging , 
                but I am here today to seek new pathways for my future career.
