        <span class="tab"></span>At San 
    Jose State University they have great ways to showcase our skills. The most famous ones are either robotic competitions or Hackathons they hold every summer. Since I am only a second year they are 
    some softwares and languages I am not fully familiary with. I have not done so many projects however, there are some I am 
    proud with especially with groupmates I worked with. During my Freshman year my group attending
    I worked on a companion robotic project. Our goal was for our little mini robot to locate sensors with 
    sensory motors that not only stop at the sensros but ot causing it to crash into walls. 
    This was a great experience due to the fact that it tied with computer, mechanical, and electrical. 
    The video below is the robot when functioning. Since I have not a lot of group experience 
    when its comes to projects I have also done labs in C++ that have really improved my knowledge on coding.

    <span class="tab"></span> Currently I am still gaining new skills when it comes to coding. 
    I am still trying to connect with people within the technical field especially on LinkedIn or on HandShake. I have 
    done extra projects however I feel most proud if this one because I have created new relationships for the first 
    time at San Jose State Univeristy through this project. Down below is a link to my LinkedIn
